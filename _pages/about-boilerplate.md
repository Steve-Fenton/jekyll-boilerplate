Jekyll Boilerplate has some Jekyll and Markdown extensions built-in. These provide essential features that are needed by most sites.

You can adjust the existing theme by changing the CSS variables, or use it as the starting point for your own bespoke design.

The customised elements include:

- [Custom front-matter](/about/front-matter/) to power nevigation features
- [Jekyll extensions](/about/jekyll-extensions/) for breadcrumbs, pagination, and search
- [Markdown extensions](/about/markdown-extensions/) for some additional markdown options

You can use an action to push your site to [GitHub Pages](/about/github-pages/)
