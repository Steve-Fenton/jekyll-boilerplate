Jekyll Boilerplate is an opinionated Jekyll site with built in theme and extensions.

The supplied theme can be customised through CSS variables, or you can use the boilerplate to build out your own custom site.

Jekyll Boilerplate doesn't depend on any plugins and works on [GitHub Pages](/about/github-pages/)

A set of features like breadcrumbs, pagination, and markdown extensions are built in.

The YAML headers have additional custom properties that give you more control over how items are displayed.
