To run Jekyll locally, set up the pre-requisites in the [Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/). You can then grab the [Jekyll Boilerplate code from GitHub](https://github.com/Steve-Fenton/jekyll-boilerplate) and run it using `jekyll serve`.

There are just a couple of tasks to turn the Jekyll Boilerplate into your own working website.

1. Edit `_config.yml`
   1. Edit the `title`
   2. Edit the `description`
   3. Edit the `owner`
   4. Edit the `url`
2. Add your analytics scripts to `analytics.html`
4. Add your icons to `/assets/icons/`

## Adjusting the Theme

You can then edit the CSS variables, or write your own stylesheet. We strongly recommend sticking with the supplied HTML and using your CSS chops to make style changes.

## Writing Content

Check out the [custom front matter](/about/front-matter/) to see how you can control how content is displayed in navigation. You can set short-titles and section titles for menu items.
