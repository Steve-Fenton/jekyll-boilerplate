Some features won't work in the GitHub Pages flavour of Jekyll as they limit extensions for security purposes. However, you can use the GitHub [Jekyll Deploy Action](https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-deploy-action){:target="blank"} to run your own build and publish to GitHub Pages

The Jekyll Deploy Action is really easy to set up and publishes the `_site` output to a branch in your repository. You just hook up GitHub Pages to the branch and it works.

That's what we're doing for this site, which runs on GitHub pages with a custom domain.

:::note

The settings for GitHub Pages are:

- Source: Deploy from a branch
- Branch: gh-pages /(root)
