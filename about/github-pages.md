Some features won't work in the GitHub Pages sandbox version of Jekyll.

However, you can use the GitHub [Jekyll Deploy Action](https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-deploy-action) to run your own build and publish to GitHub Pages.

That's what we're doing for this site, which runs of GitHub pages with a custom domain.
