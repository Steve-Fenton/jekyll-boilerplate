Welcome to Jekyll Boilerplate. A super-lightweight, accessible, SEO friendly starter project for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

:::note
This project is available on [GitHub - Jekyll Boilerplate](https://github.com/Steve-Fenton/jekyll-boilerplate){:target="_blank"}.

Jekyll Boilerplate is built on some strong opinions, such as:

- The best way to *serve* web pages is to *have* web pages
- Everything should work without JavaScript, especially the navigation
- A minimal software supply chain is easier to manage and less risky
- Accessibility is not just important, it's fundamental

> This project does **not** contain jQuery, Node modules, or front-end frameworks.
>
> It's just majestic HTML, simple CSS, and some minor non-essential enhancements in plain JavaScript. <cite>Steve Fenton</cite>

Out of the box, Jekyll Boilerplate is a "top scores" high-performance website. This is a standard test that covers the performance of the website, how fast the site is visible and interactive, whether the screen has major layout shifts, and more. As well as performance, it checks for accessibility, best practices, and SEO friendliness.

Lighthouse scores aren't everything, but the real user experience of using blazingly fast accessible websites *is*.
