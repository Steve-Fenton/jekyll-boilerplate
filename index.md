Welcome to Jekyll Boilerplate. A super-lightweight, accessible, SEO friendly starter project for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

:::note
This project is available on [GitHub - Jekyll Boilerplate](https://github.com/Steve-Fenton/jekyll-boilerplate){:target="_blank"}.
:::

Jekyll Boilerplate is built on some strong opinions, such as:

- The best way to *serve* web pages is to *have* web pages
- Everything should work without JavaScript, especially the navigation
- A minimal software supply chain is easier to manage and less risky
- Accessibility is not just important, it's fundamental

> This project does **not** contain jQuery, Node modules, or front-end frameworks.
>
> It's just majestic HTML, simple CSS, and some minor non-essential enhancements in plain JavaScript. <cite>Steve Fenton</cite>

Out of the box, Jekyll Boilerplate is a "top scores" high-performance website.

![Jekyll Boilerplate lighthouse score of 100 in performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices](/assets/img/lighthouse-scores.webp){:loading="lazy"}

Lighthouse scores aren't everything, but the real user experience of using blazingly fast accessible websites *is*.
