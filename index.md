Welcome to Jekyll Boilerplate. A super-lightweight, accessible, SEO friendly starter project for the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} site generator.

:::note
The Jekyll Boilerplate source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Steve-Fenton/jekyll-boilerplate){:target="_blank"}.

Jekyll Boilerplate is built on some strong opinions:

- Accessibility is not just important, it's fundamental
- Everythings should still work without JavaScript
- The democratising force in the World Wide Web is HTML files
- Software supply chains should be minimal

> Jekyll Boilerplate minimises third-party dependencies. There aren't any plugins, jQuery isn't in the picture, and there are no front-end frameworks.
>
> It's just majestic HTML, simple CSS, and some minor non-essential enhancements in plain JavaScript. <cite>Steve Fenton</cite>

Out of the box, Jekyll Boilerplate is a "top scores" high-performance website in the Pagespeed lab. [Pagespeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/about?hl=en-US){:target="_blank"} tests website performance on mobile and desktop across a number of measurements.
